Software design doc for The Gaming Room


*Who was the client?  What type of software did they want you to design?
The Gaming Room is a company looking to expand their outreach to mutliplatform gaming with their software "Draw it or Lose It."  They have enlisted our help to design the game and the constraints involved in its development process.  

*What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
I think that the multiplatform accessibility research is done well- the most simple path is often the one with the least things to worry about when it comes to development.  No need to overcomplicate things.  

*What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
I think that in general, I can sometimes struggle to work through the design process and throw myself straight into the code, but the industry standard coding practices were very easy to implement- as they're pretty much the same thing each time.  It's really nice to have a name for commonly used templates and designs in code.  

*If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I think I'd have to pick back up on the actual development of the game.  It seems straightforwards enough that it could be something to tackle later on towards graduation- a full scale multiplatform multiplayer game within a small scope seems reasonable.  

*How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design?  
The primary concerns were with multiplatform accessibility- which was easy enough to research and work around, especially given that it was a multiplayer, online only application.  You can outsource all the memory usage to the server and the user thne doesn't have to worry about either the storage or memory constraints.  

*Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
Well, if you don't, then you're not really giving them what they want I guess.  

*How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?  
I think the approach I took was very measured- my mind was open to the idea of a long term structured development cycle with everything preplanned, but I don't know that it's my preferred method for development.  I really like to jump in and get a working prototype as fast as possible, and, though it tends to be a pain in the ass later, fix things up once the majority of the work is already done.
